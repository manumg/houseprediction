# House Price Prediction Project

Project Overview

This repository encompasses a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project that focuses on the prediction of house prices using a variety of features. The project follows a structured approach to data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring.

Data Engineering

A data engineering process was employed to ensure the data's quality and usability. This involved:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to improve the dataset's integrity.

- Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables and normalizing features to ensure compatibility with the machine learning model.

Model Development

The centerpiece of this project is the development of a Linear Regression model, chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing linear relationships between features and the target variable:

- Feature Selection: Identified the most relevant features that influence house prices.
  
- Model Training: Utilized the cleaned and preprocessed data to train the Linear Regression model.

Deployment

The model was transformed into a usable product through a series of steps:

- Flask Web Application: Created a lightweight web app to serve as the interface for real-time predictions.
  
- Docker Containerization: Packaged the Flask app and its dependencies into a Docker container for consistency across different computing environments.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

To streamline updates and maintain the application, GitHub Actions were leveraged:

- GitHub Actions: Automated testing and deployment workflows were set up to ensure that any changes to the codebase could be smoothly integrated and deployed to the production environment.
  
- Heroku Deployment: Chose Heroku as the platform for deployment due to its ease of use and ability to handle containerized applications, enabling the model to be accessed and utilized in real-time.

Monitoring

Post-deployment, monitoring mechanisms were put in place to track the application's performance and model's accuracy, ensuring that the system remains reliable and effective over time.

Conclusion

This project exemplifies the application of various tools and technologies in building a machine learning solution that is not only accurate but also scalable and accessible to end-users. Each tool was selected to fulfill specific needs within the project pipeline, from data handling to user interaction, forming a cohesive workflow that showcases the potential of modern data science and engineering practices.
